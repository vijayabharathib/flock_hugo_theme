## Creating Top Level Pages

Let's add an "about" page and display it at the top level (as opposed to a sub-level like we did with posts).

The default in Hugo is to use the directory structure of the content/ directory to guide the location of the generated html in the public/ directory. Let's verify that by creating an "about" page at the top level:

```
$ vi content/about.md
+++
title = "about"
description = "about this site"
date = "2014-09-27"
slug = "about time"
+++

## about us

i'm speechless
:wq
```

Generate the web site and verify the results.

```
$ find public -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff   334 Sep 27 15:08 public/about-time/index.html
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff   527 Sep 27 15:08 public/index.html
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff   358 Sep 27 15:08 public/post/first-post/index.html
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff     0 Sep 27 15:08 public/post/index.html
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff   342 Sep 27 15:08 public/post/second-post/index.html
```

Notice that the page wasn't created at the top level. It was created in a sub-directory named 'about-time/'. That name came from our slug. Hugo will use the slug to name the generated content. It's a reasonable default, by the way, but we can learn a few things by fighting it for this file.

One other thing. Take a look at the home page.

```
$ cat public/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/post/theme/">creating a new theme</a></h1>
    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/about-time/">about</a></h1>
    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/post/second-post/">second</a></h1>
    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/post/first-post/">first</a></h1>
<script>document.write('<script src="http://'
        + (location.host || 'localhost').split(':')[0]
		+ ':1313/livereload.js?mindelay=10"></'
        + 'script>')</script></body>
</html>
```

Notice that the "about" link is listed with the posts? That's not desirable, so let's change that first.

```
$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <h1>posts</h1>
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if eq .Type "post"}}
      <h2><a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a></h2>
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

  <h1>pages</h1>
  {{ range .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if eq .Type "page" }}
      <h2><a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a></h2>
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}
</body>
</html>
:wq
```

Generate the web site and verify the results. The home page has two sections, posts and pages, and each section has the right set of headings and links in it.

But, that about page still renders to about-time/index.html.

```
$ find public -name '*.html' | xargs ls -l
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff    334 Sep 27 15:33 public/about-time/index.html
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff    645 Sep 27 15:33 public/index.html
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff    358 Sep 27 15:33 public/post/first-post/index.html
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff      0 Sep 27 15:33 public/post/index.html
-rw-rw-r--  1 mdhender  staff    342 Sep 27 15:33 public/post/second-post/index.html
```

Knowing that hugo is using the slug to generate the file name, the simplest solution is to change the slug. Let's do it the hard way and change the permalink in the configuration file.

```
$ vi config.toml
[permalinks]
	page = "/:title/"
	about = "/:filename/"
```

Generate the web site and verify that this didn't work. Hugo lets "slug" or "URL" override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.
